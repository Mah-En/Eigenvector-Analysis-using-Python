# Eigenvector Analysis using Python

This project explores the eigenstructure of a 2x2 matrix using Python, focusing on calculating and visualizing eigenvectors and their transformations.

## Overview

We:
- Define a matrix `A`
- Compute its eigenvalues and eigenvectors
- Normalize the eigenvectors
- Visualize the original and transformed vectors using matplotlib

This process helps us understand the geometric interpretation of eigenvectors under linear transformation.

## Files

- `eigenvector_analysis.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook with code and plots
- `eigenvectors_report.tex` — LaTeX report with detailed explanation and figure
- `eigenvectors_plot.png` — Generated plot showing eigenvectors and their transformation
- `README.md` — This file

## Requirements

Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Running the Code

1. Open the notebook or script.
2. Execute all cells or run the script.
3. A plot will be generated and saved as `eigenvectors_plot.png`.

## Output Preview

The generated plot displays:

- **Red/Blue Arrows**: Normalized eigenvectors
- **Green/Yellow Arrows**: Transformed vectors \( A \cdot v \)
